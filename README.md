# LeAccessibilityPage

# Description
The purpose of this project was to refactor the exsiting code for the Horiseon company webpage without disrupting its functionality. Doing this makes the code more concise due to removing/adusting elements in the files. Following logical semantics in all files is crucial for developers and important to practice. This project's objective enforced that accessibility of the webpage's content and functions remain intact while also refactoring both the HTML and CSS files doing so.
